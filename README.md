# West Coast Earthquake Database

### Description
It can often be difficult to find detailed information on recent earthquakes, as available data is spread out among multiple databases and usually lacks intuitive UI necessary for use by the general public. To reduce this issue, we created a web page that works with a database containing information about west coast earthquakes, allowing users to browse entries, search by several different categories, and update the database themselves.
